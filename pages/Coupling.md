- Coupling refers to the degree of independence between two modules.
	- High Coupling = Bad (Modules are closely connected and changing one module will have effect on the other module.)
	- Low Coupling = Good (Changing one module will have little impact on the other module)

- Metrics of coupling that has value for an architect
	- 1979, Edward Yourdon and Larry Constantine's Structured Design
	- Afferent Coupling
		- Number of incoming connection to a code artifact (component, class, function etc.)
	- Efferent Coupling
		- Number of outgoing connection to other code artifacts (components, class, function etc.)
- Metrics of Coupling for a deeper evaluation
	- Abstractness
		- Ratio of abstract artifacts (abstract class, interface) and concrete artifacts (implementing classes).
		- Balance must be maintained between abstractness and concreteness.
		- Too much abstraction can lead to confusion of how parts are coming together to do a particular job.
		- $$A = \frac{\sum{m^{a}}}{\sum{m^{c}}}$$
		- Here, $m^{a}$ = abstract artifacts & $m^{c}$ = concrete artifacts
	- Instability
		- It is a derived metric from Afferent and Efferent coupling.
		- Ratio of Efferent coupling and the sum of both Efferent (outgoing) and Afferent (incoming) coupling.
		- $$I = \frac{C^{e}}{C^{a} + C^{e}}$$
		- Determines volatility of a code base.
		- High Instability = Bad (Breaks more easily cause of High Coupling).
		- QUESTION Is more outgoing link causes high cohesion than more incoming link?
	- Distance From The Main Sequence
		- Derived metrics from Abstractness(A) and Instability(I)
		- $$D = |A + I - 1|$$
		- ![Distance from the main sequence in graph](../assets/image_1736271995764_0.png)
		- Upper-righthand side = zone of uselessness (code with too much abstraction)
		- Lower-lefhand side = zone of pain (code with too much implementation)
