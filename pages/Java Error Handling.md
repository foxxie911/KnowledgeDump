- All the errors that java catches are descendants of Throwable class.
- Throwable is divided into two sections
	- Error
		- Describes internal errors of Java Runtime system.
		- There is nothing to do about it rather than letting the user know that something wrong has happened and close the program.
	- Exception
		- It further divided into two parts
			- Runtime Exception
				- Exceptions such a bad cast, null pointer array, index out of bounds are runtime exception
				- These exceptions occurs because of bad code.
				- Fixing code rather than handling these exception is the best thing to do while encounter one such exception.
				- "If it is a RuntimeException, it is your fault works very well
			- I/O Exception
