- **Connascence of Name (CoN)**
	- Two elements must use the same name to work together.
	- Example: A function call and its corresponding function definition.
	- Low-risk and common in programming.
- **Connascence of Type (CoT)**
	- Two elements must agree on the type of data being exchanged.
	- Example: A function expecting an integer but receiving a string violates this.
	- Mitigation: Use static typing and type-checking tools.
- **Connascence of Meaning (CoM)**
	- Two elements rely on shared, implicit meanings.
	- Example: A method returning -1 to signify "not found."
	- Mitigation: Use explicit contracts or Enums.
- **Connascence of Position (CoP)**
	- The order of elements in a structure matters.
	- Example: A function expecting arguments in a specific order.
	- Mitigation: Use named parameters or objects.
- **Connascence of Algorithm (CoA)**
	- Two elements depend on the same algorithm.
	- Example: A function and a client using the same hashing mechanism.
	- Mitigation: Encapsulate shared algorithms in reusable modules.
