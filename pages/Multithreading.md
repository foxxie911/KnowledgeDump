## Overview

Multi-threading is like running parts of application in different CPU. A **thread** is like a CPU.

It is a virtual CPU though. Under the hood, single CPU is sharing it's resources among threads. Most popular is time sharing where CPU allocates time for each of the processes alternating between them. It happens so fast that we think that it is doing tasks simultaneously. It is possible to run threads in different cores in multi-core CPU.
