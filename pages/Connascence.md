"Two components are in connascent if a change in one would require the other to be modified in order to maintain the overall correctness of the system." - Meilir Page-Jones

- ### Types of connascence
	- **Static** Connascent
		- Refers to source-code level coupling.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- [[Types of Static Connascence]]
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Dynamic** Connascent
		- Refers to execution level coupling.
		- [[Types of Dynamic Connascence]]
	- The types of connascence depends on the degree of coupling of modules or components.

- The goal in software design regarding connascence is to:
	- **Minimize** connascence **between modules** (to reduce coupling).
	- **Maximize** connascence **within modules** (to achieve high cohesion).
