### Basic Layout
1. Engine
2. Transmission
3. Drivetrains

### Engine
Engine name has 
1. Total volume of all engine combined : 3L, 6L, 8L, 4L
2. Shape of the cylinder : V, I (Common), H (Subaru, Porsche), W (Bently, Bugatti), VR
3. Number of cylinders : 4, 6, 8

#### Induction Type
Most engines are naturally aspirated. Draws fresh air in for combustion. But Turbo Charger, Super charger more air.
- **Turbo charger** uses exhaust gases coming from engine to spin a turbine which compresses the coming air.
- **Super charger** uses the turning of the engine to cram more air in.

#### Engine Layout
1. Front : Most common
2. Middle : Exotic cars
3. Rear : Porsche uses it. Better drag and traction.

### Transmission
1. Automatic gearbox
2. Manual gearbox

### Drivetrains
1. AWD : All wheel drive. Low grip environment. expensive, heavy 
2. RWD : Lighter than AWD. Great drag. Performance car.
3. FWD : Lightest and cheapest option. Most car comes with this type drivetrains. but less drag.  

### Car Differential
A differential is a crucial component in the front or rear axle assembly, and it allows to turn without drive line windup. The engine sends power via the transmission to a driveshaft that is connected to the rear differential, where the power is split via a set of gears. These gears can increase or decrease the revolutions per minute of each wheel.
**Example**: A car doing a basic U-turn to the left and what the front and rear wheels are doing while this is happening. The left wheels, or in this case, the inside wheels, have a much shorter distance to travel than the outer right wheels. A differential's gearing allows this to happen. It will enable the inner tire to travel at less rpm while the outer tire is spinning at a higher rpm.
The differential in a car consists of:
1. Flange
2. Pinion gear
3. Drive gear
4. Bevel pinion gears
5. Half shafts
6. Spider gears
7. Differential oil

### Types of cars
1. **Economic**
2. **Muscle:** Mustang, Camero. Rear Wheel. Cheap, heavy, V8
3. **Sports:** Lighter, smaller than muscles, handling.
4. **Luxury:** Large engine but smooth. Nicer interior. Lexus, Roles Royce.
5. **Super:** Ferrari, Lamborghini. Faster, light, mid engine.
6. **Hyper:** Pagani, Bugatti. Mid engine, all wheels drive.
