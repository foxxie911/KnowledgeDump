### Basic Layout
1. Engine
2. Transmission
3. Drivetrains
### Engine
Engine name has 
1. Total volume of all engine combined : 3L, 6L, 8L, 4L
2. Shape of the cylinder : V, I (Common), H (Subaru, Porsche), W (Bently, Bugatti), VR
3. Number of cylinders : 4, 6, 8

#### Induction Type
Most engines are naturally aspirated. Draws fresh air in for combustion.
Turbo Charger, Super charger more air more explosion
Turbo charger uses exhaust gases coming from engine to spin a turbine which compresses the coming air.
Super charger uses the turning of the engine to cram more air in.

#### Engine Layout
1. Front : Most common
2. Middle : Exotic car
3. Rear : Porsche uses it. Better drag and traction.

### Transmission
1. Automatic gearbox
2. Manual gearbox

### Drivetrains
1. AWD : All wheel drive. Low grip environment. expensive, heavy 
2. RWD : Lighter than AWD. Great drag. Performance car.
3. FWD : Lightest and cheapest option. Most car comes with this type drivetrains. but less drag.  

#### Car Differential
A differential is a crucial component in the front or rear axle assembly, and it allows to turn without drive line windup. The engine sends power via the transmission to a driveshaft that is connected to the rear differential, where the power is split via a set of gears. These gears can increase or decrease the revolutions per minute of each wheel.
**Example**: A car doing a basic U-turn to the left and what the front and rear wheels are doing while this is happening. The left wheels, or in this case, the inside wheels, have a much shorter distance to travel than the outer right wheels. A differential's gearing allows this to happen. It will enable the inner tire to travel at less rpm while the outer tire is spinning at a higher rpm.
The differential in a car consists of:
1. Flange
2. Pinion gear
3. Drive gear
4. Bevel pinion gears
5. Half shafts
6. Spider gears
7. Differential oil
### Types of cars
1. **Economic**
2. **Muscle:** Mustang, Camero. Rear Wheel. Cheap, heavy, V8
3. **Sports:** Lighter, smaller than muscles, handling.
4. **Luxury:** Large engine but smooth. Nicer interior. Lexus, Roles Royce.
5. **Super:** Ferrari, Lamborghini. Faster, light, mid engine.
6. **Hyper:** Pagani, Bugatti. Mid engine, all wheels drive.
