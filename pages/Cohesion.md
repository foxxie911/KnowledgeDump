- Cohesion is the degree to which elements inside of a module relates with each other.
	- It allows to determine if a class should be inside a particular module or the class needs to form a new module or the class should be in a different module.
	- High Cohesion = Good (It means all the elements are related and focused on a single task)
	- Low Cohesion = Bad (It means elements are not related and/or not focused on a single task)
- A module is cohesive where all the necessary item resides inside the module.
- There are range of Cohesion measures:
	- Functional Cohesion
		- Everything needed is inside the module.
	- Sequential Cohesion
		- Output of one module is input of another module.
	- Communicational Cohesion
		- Two modules where they operates on the same information and/or generates some output.
	- Procedural Cohesion
		- Modules need to be executed in a particular order.
	- Temporal Cohesion
		- Modules are based on timing dependency
	- Logical Cohesion
		- The data will within the modules are related logically but not functionally.
	- Coincidental Cohesion
		- Elements are not co-related other than being on the same source file.
- Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)
	- Measures the structural cohesion of a module typically component.
	- The sum of methods that do not access shared fields.
	- LCOM low = Good cohesion (shared fields are accessed by the methods).
	- LCOM high = Bad cohesion (shred fields are not accessed by the methods).
	- Useful for architects who want to analyze the code base to move from one architecture to another.
