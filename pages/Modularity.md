- Modularity is grouping of related functions for easy understanding and management.
- Modularity is logical separation rather than physical.
	- The whole product stays the same but the functionality is divided into several sections where each section contributes to a specific functionality.
- The actual modular era was short lived which started with the Dijkstra's letter in ACM where he said `goto` statements are harmful. Later programming languages like Modula and ADA was created that supported modules which was soon overthrown by Object Oriented Programming Languages.
	- Java uses package and .NET uses namespace
- Architectures and developers use 3 concepts to understand Modularity in a given program
	- [[Cohesion]]
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- [[Coupling]]
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- [[Connascence]]
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
