- I have to keep up with the current trends in software industry.
- I have to make sure if the developer team is following the architectural patterns and designs.
- I have to have diverse exposure with the development and technology
- I will need knowledge on the domain where I will be working.
- I need to have negotiation and leadership skill to influence people to make good architectural decision.
