- Consensus protocols are a set of rules or algorithms that enable a group of independent nodes (computers) in a distributed system to agree on a single data value or sequence of values
- Consensus protocols are essential when nodes must cooperate to perform a task, such as updating a shared database or executing a transaction.
- ### Common Consensus Protocols
  collapsed:: true
	- **Paxos**
		- Developed by Leslie Lamport, designed to tolerate crash failures.
		- It ensures safety (no incorrect decisions) but may sacrifice liveness (termination) in some conditions.
		- Commonly used in systems like Google Chubby and other distributed databases.
	- **Raft**
		- An alternative to Paxos, Raft simplifies the consensus process by dividing responsibilities (leader election, log replication).
		- Designed for crash-fault tolerance and is used in systems like HashiCorp Consul and etcd.
	- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**
		- Used in distributed databases to ensure atomic transactions.
		- Requires all nodes to vote (commit or abort) before a transaction is finalized.
		- Simple but not fault-tolerantâ€”if the coordinator crashes, progress halts.
	- **Three-Phase Commit (3PC)**
		- An improvement over 2PC that introduces an extra phase to handle coordinator crashes.
		- Adds more complexity but improves fault tolerance under certain conditions.
	- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**
		- A class of protocols designed to handle malicious nodes that may intentionally try to disrupt the system.
		- Used in permissioned blockchain systems and other secure distributed systems.
	- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**
		- Used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
		- Requires nodes to solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain.
		- Energy-intensive but effective for open, decentralized systems.
	- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**
		- An energy-efficient alternative to PoW, used in systems like Ethereum 2.0.
		- Nodes stake their cryptocurrency holdings to participate in consensus and validate transactions
- ### Applications of Consensus Protocols
  collapsed:: true
	- Blockchain Technology
		- Ensuring the integrity and security of transactions in cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications.
	- Distributed Databases
		- Maintaining consistency and data integrity across multiple nodes.
	- Cloud Computing
		- Coordinating tasks and resource allocation in large-scale distributed systems.
	- Fault-Tolerant Systems
		- Building highly reliable systems that can withstand node failures.
