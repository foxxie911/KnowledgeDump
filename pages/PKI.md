### Overview

PKI, or **public key infrastructure**, encompasses everything used to establish and manage public key encryption. This includes software, hardware, policies, and procedures that are used to create, distribute, manage, store, and revoke **digital certificates**.
A digital certificate cryptographically links a public key with the device or user who owns it. This helps to authenticate users and devices and ensure secure digital communications.
