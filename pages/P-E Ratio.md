### Overview

P/E Ratio is **price-to-earning ratio**.  The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company's **share price relative to its earnings per share** (EPS). Often called the price or earnings multiple, the P/E ratio helps assess the relative value of a company's stock. It's handy for comparing a company's valuation against its historical performance, against other firms within its industry, or the overall market.

The P/E ratio is one of the most widely used by investors and analysts reviewing a stock's relative valuation. It helps to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

Analysts and investors review a company's P/E ratio to determine if the share price accurately represents the projected earnings per share.

There are two types of P-E ration:
 1. **Forward Ratio**: Predicts future prediction depending on historic data.
 2. **Backward Ratio**: Calculates past performance.
