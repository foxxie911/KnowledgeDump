- Here, Java is used to build the HTTP Server
- After creating and project and initializing git, Go to the `main.java` file.
- Bind a port to the server using `ServerSocket` package library of Java.

```java
  try {
	ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(4221);
	// Since the tester restarts your program quite often, setting SO_REUSEADDR
	// ensures that we don't run into 'Address already in use' errors
	serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
	serverSocket.accept(); // Wait for connection from client.
	System.out.println("accepted new connection");
  } catch (IOException e) {
	System.out.println("IOException: " + e.getMessage());
  }
```

- Implement  [[HTTP Message]] management.
	- Server should be able to response to incoming requests from client and the response should vary from request to request.
