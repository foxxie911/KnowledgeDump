	- Laravel can automatically scrap out the required information if passed variable and route point matches the required information. Additionally, I need to pass the class name before the variable declaration.
	- ```php
	  Route::get('/jobs/{$job}', function(Job $job){
	    return view('jobs.show', ['job' => $job])
	  })
	  ```
	- The default column Laravel routes caches is the 'id'. But it is not always the case such as for "post". In that case, I will have to a colon after the route  inside the `{ }` and pass the desired column name. `Route::get('/posts/{$post:slug}', function(...)`.
	- `web.php` is default location for the routes. But it gets messy real soon. To make things cleaner [[Laravel Controller]] classes are used.
	- For the routes which shows only static contents or view, there is a Laravel Route function for shortcut which is `Route::view('$PAGE_ROUTE', '$PAGE_VIEW)`.
	- For listing all the created routes `php artisan route:list --except-vendor`
